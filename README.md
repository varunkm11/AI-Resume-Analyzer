## Customization

### Adding New Job Roles

To add a new job role, modify the `JOB_ROLES` dictionary in `app.py`:

```python
JOB_ROLES["New Role"] = {
    "technical_skills": ["skill1", "skill2", ...],
    "soft_skills": ["skill1", "skill2", ...],
    "experience_keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...],
    "education_keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...]
}
```

### Adjusting Score Weights

Modify the scoring weights in the `calculate_ats_score` function:

```python
technical_score = (technical_matches / len(role_requirements["technical_skills"])) * 40  # 40% weight
soft_score = (soft_matches / len(role_requirements["soft_skills"])) * 20              # 20% weight
experience_score = (experience_matches / len(role_requirements["experience_keywords"])) * 25  # 25% weight
education_score = (education_matches / len(role_requirements["education_keywords"])) * 15     # 15% weight
```
